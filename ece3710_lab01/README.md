Lab 1: Debugging with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Objective: The student should become familiar with the process of building, downloading, debugging and running programs on a microcontroller using an IDE

Parts: 1-C8051FX20-TB Evaluation Board 1-USB Debug Adapter

Software: Silicon Laboratories IDE version 3.50.00 or greater

Preparation: No preparation is required for this lab. You should have time to complete the lab during the lab period.

Procedure: Write the title and a short description of this lab in your lab book. Make sure the page is numbered and make an entry in the table of contents for this lab.

Create a text file named lab1.asm that contains the following 8051 assembly code. Note that this code contains errors.

IMPORTANT: One of the most common sources of trouble that students encounter comes from poor file organization. Create a folder that will contain each of the labs and projects we will do this semester; then, when a lab or project is assigned, create a new folder in that master folder to hold all of the code for that project. Feel free to copy from previous labs or projects but never update code that works for an earlier lab or project so that it will work with the current one. You must always be able to back out to an earlier lab and have confidence that it will still work.
